- BREAKING: Parrot.playMusic now returns MusicInstance instead of Music. MusicInstance exposes the Music object along with some additional data.
- Added a new parameter "position" to Parrot.playMusic, which allows music to start from different playback positions.
- Added a priority parameter to ParrotSoundType and SoundInstance, which changes the order of sounds killed while limiting voices.
- Added "NonRandomShuffle" algorithm for picking different sounds every time, and avoiding the same sound files from repeating themselves. Thanks @BambooBandit!
- Added SoundInstance.getInternalId(), which returns the value returned by Sound.play, and Boom.
- Added "Ignore Distant Tiny Sounds" feature, which is an optional mechanism that prevents short sounds from being played if they're too far from the listener.
- Fixed "volumeFactor" never being reset on SoundInstance's reset method.
- Fixed "volumeVariation" being recalculated every frame instead of just once, causing sounds to sound very choppy.
- BREAKING: Removed setting "soundDistanceReduction".
- BREAKING: Renamed setting "soundDistanceLimit" to "distanceRolloffMaxDistance".
- Added a new setting "distanceRolloffMinDistance" to control at what distance does volume starts getting affected.
- Added a new setting "distanceRolloffMinGain" to determine the minimum multiplier that can be applied to sound volume based off distance.
- Added a new setting "distanceRolloffCurve" to control the drop off curve that sound volume gets based off distance.

[0.0.3]
- BREAKING: Added a new parameter "volumeFactor" to some "playSound" methods of SoundPlayer and Parrot to allow for easy volume manipulation on play.
    - If you extended SoundPlayer or Parrot, you will have to adapt the methods being overridden.
- BREAKING: Fixed typo "soundSontinuousFadeIn" in ParrotSettings. The field is now called "soundContinuousFadeIn".
    - If you used to access this field directly, you will need to fix the typo in your project as well.
- Added SoundInstance.getSound(), which returns the underlying libGDX Sound instance being used.
- Added MusicInstance.getMusic(), which returns the underlying libGDX Music instance being used.
- Added "volumeVariation" to ParrotSoundType, which automatically applies a random volume variation when played.
