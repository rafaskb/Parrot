- BREAKING: Fixed typo "soundSontinuousFadeIn" in ParrotSettings. The field is now called "soundContinuousFadeIn".
- Added SoundInstance.getSound(), which returns the underlying libGDX Sound instance being used.
- Added MusicInstance.getMusic(), which returns the underlying libGDX Music instance being used.
- Added "volumeVariation" to ParrotSoundType, which automatically applies a random volume variation when played.
